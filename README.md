  <br>Home Assistant Configuration

This repo contains the working [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration for **Casa Maxson**. Below are links to the devices currently being used, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config. All of the code is free to use.

And of course, if you have hit that :star: at the top to follow this repo what are you waiting for? You can get updates right in your notification feed everytime I push updates. Which is at least once a week and some weeks quite a bit more.  

#### Anchorage House's Three Laws of Home Automation 

When designing Anchorage House's automations I have made every effort to prioritize the solution based on the following three laws. 

**First Law: Every automation or action should be the result of a passive sensor or indirect action**.

**Second Law: An automation can be triggered by voice command only when Law 1 cannot be achieved**.

**Third Law: An automation or action can be trigger by a physical switch or as the result of a direct iteraction only when Law 1 and Law 2 cannot be achieved.**
